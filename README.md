# ProveKit

Zero-knowledge proof toolkit targeting mobile devices.

## Demo instructions

First make sure you have the exact correct version of Noir installed [so the artifacts can be read](./Cargo.toml#L58):

```sh
noirup -C 03b58fa2
```

Compile the Noir circuit and generate the witness:

```sh
cd noir-r1cs/noir-examples/poseidon-rounds
nargo execute
```

Generate the R1CS instance:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin noir-r1cs ./noir-r1cs/noir-examples/poseidon-rounds/target/basic.json ./noir-r1cs/noir-examples/poseidon-rounds/target/basic.gz
```

Generate the WHIR GR1CS proof:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin prover -- --input_file_path ./noir-r1cs/r1cs.json
```

This will write the proof to `prover/proof`.

Recursively verify in a Gnark proof (reads the proof from `../ProveKit/prover/proof`):

```sh
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/reilabs/gnark-whir
cd gnark-whir
go run .
```
