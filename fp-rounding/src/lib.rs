    // Caveat in the talk is that this should only be used for benchmarking.

    // Compiler fences have been tried but they do not work. The compiler can see
    // that the mode has independent memory access from val and thus it doesn't
    // prevent reordering.

    // This leaves us with read_volatile which is close to C's volatile behaviour.
    // Downside of this approach is that it adds load and store instructions
    // compared to no extra instructions for black_box/empty assembly block.

    // either mode or val alone will not have the desired effect.
