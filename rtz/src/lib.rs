//! Round Toward Zero (RTZ) floating-point rounding mode control
//!
//! Rust/LLVM does not support different float point mode rounding modes and
//! this module provides abstractions to able to control the aarch64
//! FPCR (Floating-point Control Register) rounding mode. For how this module
//! provides a safe abstraction see the documentation of [`RTZ`].

/// Proof that Round Toward Zero (RTZ) has been set
///
/// This struct must to be passed as a (unused) reference to any function that
/// requires round toward zero for correct operation. The struct serves as a
/// proof that RTZ is set and we rely on the lifetime introduced
/// by the reference to enforce the ordering of the FPCR operations relative to
/// the multiplication. This way we can prevent the reset of FPCR to bubble up
/// in front of the multiplication.
///
/// This type provides RAII-style management of the aarch64 FPCR (Floating-point
/// Control Register), specifically for controlling the rounding mode. When
/// created, it sets the rounding mode to "round toward zero" and restores the
/// previous mode when dropped.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This struct maintains the following invariants:
/// - The previous FPCR value is always restored on drop
/// - The type cannot be sent between threads
///
/// This type is marked !Send + !Sync because FPCR is a per-core / per OS-thread
/// register.
